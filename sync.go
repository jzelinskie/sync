// A Pool is a set of temporary objects that may be individually saved and
// retrieved.
//
// Any item stored in the Pool may be removed automatically at any time without
// notification. If the Pool holds the only reference when this happens, the
// item might be deallocated.
//
// A Pool is safe for use by multiple goroutines simultaneously.
//
// Pool's purpose is to cache allocated but unused items for later reuse,
// relieving pressure on the garbage collector. That is, it makes it easy to
// build efficient, thread-safe free lists. However, it is not suitable for all
// free lists.
//
// An appropriate use of a Pool is to manage a group of temporary items
// silently shared among and potentially reused by concurrent independent
// clients of a package. Pool provides a way to amortize allocation overhead
// across many clients.
//
// An example of good use of a Pool is in the fmt package, which maintains a
// dynamically-sized store of temporary output buffers. The store scales under
// load (when many goroutines are actively printing) and shrinks when
// quiescent.
//
// On the other hand, a free list maintained as part of a short-lived object is
// not a suitable use for a Pool, since the overhead does not amortize well in
// that scenario. It is more efficient to have such objects implement their own
// free list.
//
// A Pool must not be copied after first use.
//
// In the terminology of the Go memory model, a call to Put(x) "synchronizes
// before" a call to Get returning that same value x.
// Similarly, a call to New returning x "synchronizes before"
// a call to Get returning that same value x.

// ReadHeavyMap is like a Go map[any]any but is safe for concurrent use
// by multiple goroutines without additional locking or coordination.
// Loads, stores, and deletes run in amortized constant time.
//
// The Map type is specialized. Most code should use a plain Go map instead,
// with separate locking or coordination, for better type safety and to make it
// easier to maintain other invariants along with the map content.
//
// The Map type is optimized for two common use cases: (1) when the entry for a given
// key is only ever written once but read many times, as in caches that only grow,
// or (2) when multiple goroutines read, write, and overwrite entries for disjoint
// sets of keys. In these two cases, use of a Map may significantly reduce lock
// contention compared to a Go map paired with a separate Mutex or RWMutex.
//
// The zero Map is empty and ready for use. A Map must not be copied after first use.
//
// In the terminology of the Go memory model, Map arranges that a write operation
// “synchronizes before” any read operation that observes the effect of the write, where
// read and write operations are defined as follows.
// Load, LoadAndDelete, LoadOrStore, Swap, CompareAndSwap, and CompareAndDelete
// are read operations; Delete, LoadAndDelete, Store, and Swap are write operations;
// LoadOrStore is a write operation when it returns loaded set to false;
// CompareAndSwap is a write operation when it returns swapped set to true;
// and CompareAndDelete is a write operation when it returns deleted set to true.
type ReadHeavyMap = sync.Map

// Map is a Go map protected by a [sync.RWMutex].
// It is preferred over [sync.Map] for maps with entries that change
// at a relatively high frequency.

// A WaitGroup waits for a collection of goroutines to finish.
// The main goroutine calls Add to set the number of
// goroutines to wait for. Then each of the goroutines
// runs and calls Done when finished. At the same time,
// Wait can be used to block until all goroutines have finished.
//
// A WaitGroup must not be copied after first use.
//
// In the terminology of the Go memory model, a call to Done
// “synchronizes before” the return of any Wait call that it unblocks.
type WaitGroup = sync.WaitGroup

// An ErrGroup is a collection of goroutines working on subtasks that are part
// of the same overall task.

// and does not cancel on error.

// A Mutex is a mutual exclusion lock.
// The zero value for a Mutex is an unlocked mutex.
//
// A Mutex must not be copied after first use.
//
// In the terminology of the Go memory model,
// the n'th call to Unlock “synchronizes before” the m'th call to Lock
// for any n < m.
// A successful call to TryLock is equivalent to a call to Lock.
// A failed call to TryLock does not establish any “synchronizes before”
// relation at all.
type Mutex = sync.Mutex

// There is a modified copy of this file in runtime/rwmutex.go.
// If you make any changes here, see if you should make them there.

// A RWMutex is a reader/writer mutual exclusion lock.
// The lock can be held by an arbitrary number of readers or a single writer.
// The zero value for a RWMutex is an unlocked mutex.
//
// A RWMutex must not be copied after first use.
//
// If any goroutine calls Lock while the lock is already held by
// one or more readers, concurrent calls to RLock will block until
// the writer has acquired (and released) the lock, to ensure that
// the lock eventually becomes available to the writer.
// Note that this prohibits recursive read-locking.
//
// In the terminology of the Go memory model,
// the n'th call to Unlock "synchronizes before" the m'th call to Lock
// for any n < m, just as for Mutex.
// For any call to RLock, there exists an n such that
// the n'th call to Unlock "synchronizes before" that call to RLock,
// and the corresponding call to RUnlock "synchronizes before"
// the n+1'th call to Lock.
